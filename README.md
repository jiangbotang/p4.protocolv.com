csci e-15 project 4

This website is built to store and organize research information. 

The layout, a large part of the css and background picture files are from a free css template, the
template can be found at http://www.templatemonster.com/free-templates/free-science-html5-template.php
Please note, the template only provided html and css, no thing else.

My work including the following:
1. Although I used the layout, and background pictures, all the contents of the website are from my work.
2. Modify html and css to meet my requirement. 
3. Implemented MVC pattern for the website, the original template is just plain html.
4. Implemented user login and signup using php and the course customer framework.
5. Implemented storing data into and display them from database.
6. Implemented navigation functions to display db data page by page.
7. Implemented adding information to database with Ajax, e.g. adding a primer, or plasmid to the databse.
8. Implemented form input validation with a JQuery validator plugin. (http://formvalidator.net/index.html)

next step:
1. Implemented more rigorous server side data validator. Right now, it relies heavily on client side Javascript.
2. Impproving data display layout.



To teaching assistant:
1. There is a database.sql file under the root directory of the application. It can be used to restore database tables 
	used by this application.
