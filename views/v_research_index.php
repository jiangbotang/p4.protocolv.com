          <p>The way chemotherapy and radiotherapy works is that they induce damage to our cells. Most of the cancer treatment
             drugs and radiation impose serious damage to our genetic material DNA. Cells of our body, cancer cells included, 
             have developed mechanisms to repair those damage, thus provide resistance to treatment. I study how cells repair the
            damage to find better drugs and treatment strategy.</p>

        <p class="pad_bot2 marg_top"><strong>Chromatin structure, DNA repair, and PARP inhibitors </strong></p>
        <p class="pad_bot2">Radiation therapy, as well as PARP inhibitors, induces damage to cancer cells by breaking their DNA. However, cancer cells, like our normal cells, can manage to repair the breaks. The repair process happens in the 
         context of chromatin, in which DNA is packed and organized.<br>Chromatin structure, particularly, acetylation of histone tails 
         affects the repair process.</p>

        <p class="pad_bot2 marg_top"><strong>Breast cancer biomarker </strong></p>
        <p class="pad_bot2">BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most important breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. Many mutations
           have been reported in both of the BRCA genes, with some of the mutations associated with increased susceptibility 
           to breast cancer.<br>
          Please following the link below to read my research on identifying a new breast cancer biomarker in the BRCA1 gene.</p>

        <p class="pad_bot2 marg_top"><strong>Glioma and chemotherapy </strong></p>
        <p class="pad_bot2">Temozolomide (TMZ) is the preferred chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of glioma following
         surgical resection and/or radiation. Resistance to TMZ is attributed to efficient repair and/or tolerance of
          TMZ-induced DNA lesions.<br>
          we report here that potentiation of TMZ via BER inhibition [methoxyamine (MX), the PARP inhibitors PJ34 and 
          ABT-888 or depletion (knockdown) of PARG] is greatly enhanced by...</p>
